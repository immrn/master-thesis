FreeOTP is a two-factor authentication (2FA) application for systems utilizing one-time password protocols (OTP).
Tokens can be added easily by scanning a QR-code or by manually entering in the token configuration.

FreeOTP implements open standards. This means that no proprietary server-side component is necessary:
use any server-side component that implements these standards â€” for example FreeIPA, which uses TOTP.
Any standards-compliant implementation will work.
Currently, FreeOTP provides implementations of HOTP (RFC 4226) and TOTP (RFC 6238).
